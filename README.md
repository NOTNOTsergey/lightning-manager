## - Information

​	The manager encrypts your passwords with symmetric encryption and thus does not give **anyone but you** access to the passwords. Access can be obtained by username and password, which also reduces the chance of someone getting into the database. I want to draw your attention to the fact that **not a single element of the database is stored in the open form**, that is, even if the attackers receive the entire database, it will not give them anything. If you do not need such encryption, then for you there is a password manager without encryption with sqlalchemy base (at the link below). In Lightning manager i used my type of database and its takes up less space then sqlalchemy.
